analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,36.0,36) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
At utterance end, t_E accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 80.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,15.8,24) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,36.0,36) frames.
Overall, 6_I accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
Overall, m_B accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
Overall, o8_I accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,9.0,9) frames.
Overall, t_E accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 36.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 57.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
