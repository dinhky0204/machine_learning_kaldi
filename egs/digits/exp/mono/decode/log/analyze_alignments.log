analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,27.0,27) frames.
At utterance begin, m_B accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,27.0,27) frames.
At utterance end, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (44,44.0,44) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 75.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,18.3,25) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (44,44.0,44) frames.
Overall, m_B accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,27.0,27) frames.
Overall, o86_I accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,25.0,25) frames.
Overall, t_E accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 0.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 28.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
